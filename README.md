NeuroSurgeon is a python toolkit built to enable deep learning researchers to easily uncover and manipulate subnetworks within trained models. NeuroSurgeon provides a simple API to inject differentiable binary masks techniques into linear, attention, and convolution layers in BERT, GPT, ResNet, and ViT-style models within Huggingface Transformers. Differentiable masking has a variety of use cases for deep learning research, such as:
