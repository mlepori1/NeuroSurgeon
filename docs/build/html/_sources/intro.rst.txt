Introduction
============

``NeuroSurgeon`` is a python toolkit built to enable deep learning researchers to easily uncover and manipulate subnetworks within trained models. NeuroSurgeon provides a simple API to inject differentiable binary masks techniques into linear, attention, and convolution layers in BERT, GPT, ResNet, and ViT-style models within Huggingface Transformers.
Differentiable masking has several use cases, including:

* Pruning to uncover functional subnetworks
